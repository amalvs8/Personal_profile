            <p style="font-size:14px;">
                I started my journey into Web Development with my first project of printing "Hello World" in python.
                Ever since then, I was eager to find solutions to every problem that came across.
                My first project was to create a Movie Database website using Python and Django Framework. I used Python
                and Django in back-end side and HTML, CSS & Bootstrap in front-end side. Also developed a To-Do list
                application and E-cart Shopping Application in similar manner. Then I came across Django REST framework
                and began to experiment with it. I have developed the same Movie Database website using RESTful frame work.
